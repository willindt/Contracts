# Recovery Protocol Contracts

Attempted to set up BUSD rewards - unable to make distributeDividends (add BNB function) allow to add BUSD. May need to stick with BNB ver if too complex.

- Successfully distributes BUSD. 
- Only unable to add BUSD instead of BNB using the 'distributeDividends' function manually

[Original functioning BNB version](https://github.com/Triex/Dui-Contract-V2/tree/master/Recovery%20Protocol)

## Usage
```setBalances ["0x00addr00,0x00addr01,0x00addr02 etc & numbers of holdings in the same format 100000,50000,35000 etc```
